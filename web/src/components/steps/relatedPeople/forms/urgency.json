You give notice to the other party by having the application documents served personally to them.\n<br>\n<br>\nA judge can decide to review your application without the other party being given notice until after the Protection Order is made if notice on the other party is unreasonable because of special circumstances like you or your children are in imminent danger of harm, or providing notice in advance would probably have serious consequences.\n<br>\n<br>\nA judge can also decide to change the amount of notice you give the other party if the judge decides the other party should be served before making a decision about the protection order but your situation requires a court order sooner than 7 days.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe period of time between the day that the other party is served and the day that the application is heard is called the \"notice period\" or \"notice\".\n<br>\nNormally, you must serve the other party with at least 7 days' notice of the court appearance. If you serve the other party with less than 7 daysâ€™ notice, the court will decide if the amount of notice you gave was reasonable and if a protection order should be made without proper notice or without the other party being present in court to tell their story.",
